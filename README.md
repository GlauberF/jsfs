Unlimited JavaScript Access to Computer Resources without Browser Plugins

JSFS provides a secure solution to access computer resources by JavaScript on web pages of enterprise applications. It does not make use of a browser plugin technology (e.g. ActiveX or Java Applet), and it does not claim to reduce browser security settings.
