Unlimited JavaScript Access to Computer Resources without Browser Plugins

JSFS provides a secure solution to access computer resources by JavaScript on web pages of enterprise applications. It does not make use of a browser plugin technology (e.g. ActiveX or Java Applet), and it does not claim to reduce browser security settings. 

More information can be found in doc/Documentation.pdf.

JSFS is available under the MIT license.
